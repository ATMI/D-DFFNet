# [ICME 2023] Depth and DOF Cues Make Better Defocus Blur Detection

This repository contains the official Pytorch implementation of our ICME 2023 paper.

## Dataset
We collect a new dataset EBD for testing. Please download from this link if you plan to use it. [EBD dataset](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1mL9gYu-2tnKR4lQoB3jAOA?pwd=cqoz) 

## Pretrained Models
We provide pretrained models of our DFFNet and D-DFFNet with three different training data as listed in our paper.

## Results
We provide results on four test datasets. We use three different training data for fair comparison with previous works, here we provide all results related to the three different training data.
