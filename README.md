This repository contains the official Pytorch implementation of our ICME 2023 paper.

## Dataset
We collect a new dataset EBD for testing. Please download from this link if you plan to use it.

## Pretrained Models
We provide pretrained models of our DFFNet and D-DFFNet with three different training data as listed in our paper.

 Training data | CUHK1  | 表头
 ---- | ----- | ------  
 DFFNet  | 单元格内容 | 单元格内容 
 DFFNet  | 单元格内容 | 单元格内容   


## Results
We provide results on four test datasets. We use three different training data for fair comparison with previous works, here we provide all results related to the three different training data.
